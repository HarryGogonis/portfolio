### Learner
I have a passion for learning new things, experimenting with technologies, and trying new ideas.
I believe that "the most dangerous phrase in the language is we've always done it this way".

###  Self-Directed
I don't need a perfect specification or UI design to drive a feature to completion.

###  Product Focused
The customer's experience is the most important thing. I want the customers to enjoy the product and tell all their friends about it.

### Open Source Contributor
I am active in the JavaScript community and have a few open source libraries on [GitHub](https://github.com/HarryGogonis) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~harrygogonis).
